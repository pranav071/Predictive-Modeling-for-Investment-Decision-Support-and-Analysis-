Introduction
The primary goals of this project are:

Predictive Modeling for Investment Returns: Building models to predict high investment returns based on factors such as location, role, and investment behavior.
Risk Assessment: Developing models to assess investment risk levels based on attributes like knowledge level and investment influencers.

By leveraging machine learning techniques and data analysis, this project aims to provide valuable insights and decision support for investors and financial professionals.
Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing demographic information, employment details, investment behavior insights, and financial data. The dataset consists of 810 entries across 19 columns and includes features such as city, gender, marital status, age, education, role, income, investment returns, and risk levels.
Analysis
The analysis phase of the project includes:

Data Exploration: Loading and inspecting the dataset, handling missing values, and understanding the structure and statistical summary.
Demographic Distribution Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of categorical variables like city, gender, marital status, and age using visualizations (bar graphs and donut charts).
Employment Details Analysis: Exploring role distribution, education levels, and income brackets through data visualization techniques.
Behavior Insights Analysis: Investigating factors such as knowledge levels about investment products, sources of awareness, investment influencers, reasons for investment, and the percentage of household income invested.

Predictive Modeling
The predictive modeling phase involves:

Investment Return Prediction: Building models using selected attributes (city, role, reason for investment) due to their high correlation with investment returns. Various classification, regression, and neural network models are evaluated, with the Random Forest Classifier achieving the highest accuracy.
Risk Prediction: Training and evaluating different models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and neural networks, to predict investment risk levels based on knowledge level about the share market.

Results
The key results from the project include:

Identification of the Marketing and Sales Executive role in Seattle as being associated with the highest investment returns.
The Random Forest Classifier model achieving an accuracy of 83% in predicting high investment returns for Marketing and Sales Executives in Seattle.
A Sequential neural network model demonstrating an accuracy of 94.6% in predicting risk levels based on knowledge of the share market.
Validation of the models on synthetic and actual datasets, with accuracies of 96% and 82.3%, respectively.

Future Work
Potential areas for future work include:

Feature engineering to explore additional factors that may impact investment returns.
Model optimization through hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and exploration of alternative models like ensemble methods or deep learning.
Conducting longitudinal studies to track investor behavior and outcomes over time for deeper insights into long-term investment success factors.
